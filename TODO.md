      - [ ] generate mountains at fault-line chunks
      - [ ] generate fault-line chunks using a threshold on a noise map
        - [ ] use another noise function which is designed to have ridges at these lines to decide the strength of the fault-line
        - [ ] Strength of fault determines how extreme/tall the mountains will be
        - [ ] if strength is high enough, the mountain may be a volcano.
